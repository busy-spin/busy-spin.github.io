As a developer, I like installing all services in my local using kubernetes.
Mariadb, MongoDB, prometheus, redis, kafka all these services can be spin up, tear down and clean up very easily by having a k8s clster locally.
From all methods out there to install k8s in local, my preferred is using `minikube`
