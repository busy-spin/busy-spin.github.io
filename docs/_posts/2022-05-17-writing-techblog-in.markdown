I'm love the simplicity of markdown. It's the de facto documentation method preferred by coders like me.
So I thought of writing my blogs using mark down. 

This is two parts problem. 

## 1. How to host markdown based blog
Here is the [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
on how to host markdown based blog/website with github

## 2. How to run blog locally

Here is the [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) 
on how to run you blog/website locally.
