# A B C methodology for achieving Goals 

## TL;DR

There are countless times in my life I have set big goals. Then made perfect plans that should work like clock works.
It was exciting to do goal setting, even more exciting to list down how I should execute that plan daily, 
later to only find out that, I am a fragile humans living in chaotic world of distraction.
But irrespective of perfect plans works or not, accumulated effort always brings us closer to the goals and sometimes helps us achieve these goals. 
However, constant feel of regret of not been able to execute the perfect plan is a daily mood killer. 

A B C methodology is something I came across recently. It sounds rationale and relatable to me. 

## Why perfect plans don't work

When we create plans, we don't take into account the daily nuance. Each day is not the same. 
If you create a plan that involve shifting between activities with minute perfection. 
Its unlikely you are going to achieve this daily basis. 
Sometime these plans are way too hardcore.

## Add a little imperfection

Sometime little imperfection improve things. What if you create a plan that there is harmony between perfection and imperfection.
Add a little flaw deliberately, to make your self wonder. Keep things interesting and make the effort more sustainable.

## A-B-C Methodology 

A-B-C methodology was introduced to me in [Sahil Bloom](https://www.youtube.com/@Sahil_Bloom) video [My System for UNBREAKABLE Goal Setting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvYsD_bM-RM).
And I got here thanks to the best channel for productivity [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal), and this particular video [5 Easy Ways to Become More Self-Disciplined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFSMQJCda10).
